## 📖 Project Overview  
This mini project visualizes **Register Allocation** using the **Graph Coloring algorithm**, a core concept in compiler optimization.  
It connects to **SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)** by promoting **efficient resource utilization** — minimizing hardware register use, which reduces energy consumption and improves computational sustainability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Demonstrate how graph coloring optimizes register allocation.  
- Visualize variable conflicts and color assignments interactively.  
- Promote sustainable computing practices by efficient resource sharing.  
- Align with **SDG 12** by minimizing digital waste and energy usage.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **HTML5** – Structure of the visualization interface  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Implements graph coloring logic and interactivity

📊 How It Works
Each variable in a program is represented as a node.

Edges between nodes show conflicts — variables that can’t share the same register.

Graph coloring assigns different colors (registers) to each node so that no connected nodes share the same one.

The goal is to minimize the total number of colors (registers) used.

💡 Example Visualization
Node	Assigned Register
A	R1
B	R2
C	R1
D	R3

🌍 SDG 12 Connection
